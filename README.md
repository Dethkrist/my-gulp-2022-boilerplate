## My GULP 2022 boilerplate

## This is a standard GULP boilerplate, used for work with regular non-complicated sites and markup.

Good and easy for newbies or normal developers, it can:

* Work both with PUG and HTML (You need to change file extensions in "path" file, and redact "html" task, see comments)
* Convert SASS/SCSS into css
* Bundle css, js, html files
* Convert images into WEBP and PNG if you need, and optimize them
* Create SVG Sprites
* Zip your project
* Send it to an FTP server
* Convert fonts
* Run local dev server

#### To install it, clone this rep, and run "npm install" to install all dependencies

### Scripts: 

* npm run dev - start in development mode
* npm run build - build project
